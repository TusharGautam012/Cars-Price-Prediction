🚗 Car Price Prediction using Machine Learning

📌 Project Overview :- 

This project predicts the selling price of cars based on various features such as brand, model, year, fuel type, transmission, and mileage. It uses machine learning techniques to analyze historical data and build an accurate prediction model.
The main goal is to help users estimate a fair price for a car using data-driven insights.

📊 Dataset :- 

The dataset contains information about used cars, including:
Car Name
Year of Purchase
Present Price
Selling Price
Fuel Type
Seller Type
Transmission
Number of Owners
Data preprocessing and cleaning were performed before training the model.

⚙️ Technologies & Libraries Used :- 

Python
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Scikit-learn
Jupyter Notebook

🧠 Machine Learning Algorithm :- 

Linear Regression
The model was trained using a train-test split and evaluated using standard performance metrics.

🔄 Project Workflow :- 

Data Collection
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Feature Encoding
Train-Test Split
Model Training
Model Evaluation
Price Prediction

📈 Results :- 

The model is able to predict car prices with good accuracy after proper preprocessing and feature engineering. Performance is evaluated using regression metrics.
